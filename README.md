Speech Recognition - Hidden Markov Model - Computation of likelihoods and training the model

Given the parameters for a Hidden Marcov Model, the requirement in is to calculate a series of likelihoods (forward, backward, occupation and transition) and then re-estimate the model parameters by training on 5 different observation sequences.
